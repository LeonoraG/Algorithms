# Contributing
## This is a collection of programmed algorithms
## How to contribute
- Create a pull request that adds a new `Algorithm` program.
- Create a directory for the algorithm if it is not added currently. Same algorithm written in different languages should come in the same directory.
- The new file must be named `<language_name>.<extension>`
- The pull request must be named `Add <language_name> <algorithm_name>`
- All the programs should be properly commented.
- All the programs should explain how to run the program and it should contain an example case demonstrated.
- Remember to reference issue in the PR description #issue_number 
- Only one algorithm in one language per pull request
- Don't add existing algorithms in existing languages programs in the repo.


## I will merge your pull request on condition that it's valid.
